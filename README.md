## Titanic Data Analysis 
Finding important information about the passengers and variables affecting survival rates during the notorious maritime catastrophe is the goal of this project's exploration of the Titanic dataset.

## Key Highlights
- Survival by Gender and Class: Analyze how survival rates varied significantly between men and women, as well as across ticket classes.
- Age Distribution: Study the role of age in survival, focusing on children and the elderly.
- Family Dynamics: Investigate how traveling with family impacted survival chances compared to solo travelers.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values and prepare data for meaningful analysis.

## Tools and Techniques:
- Python Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and NumPy for numerical computations.
- Statistical Analysis: Conduct correlation studies to identify key survival determinants.
- Power BI : Visuvalization of the Data
